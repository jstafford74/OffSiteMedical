This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Application WorkFlow 
(https://github.com/jstafford74/OffSiteMedical/blob/master/OffsiteMed%20DB%20design.png)

The entry point for this application is a splash landing page that will provide basic content and collateral and allow the visitor to take 2 actions: `Create Profile` & `Login`

### There will be 2 types of profiles: `Personal` & `Enterprise`
  Both profile types will allow the user to enter basic informatio(name, address, email).
  
  The Enterprise profile type upon logging in will see a `Create Offsite Event` application that allows the user to pick a date,        start & end time, company name & location and preferred contact. 
  
### 3 pages: 
#### Splash/Landing
#### Create Profile
#### Profile Page

## Database Design & Testing

###Testing & Model Design
Using the sequelize-auto package I created models in the `./models` folder from the command line.  The tables were already set up on my localhost using the `forward engineering` tool from the mysql workbench after diagramming.

The commandline for sequelize looked something like this:
`$ sequelize-auto -o "./models" -h localhost -d offsitemedical -u root -p 3306 -x 'my_password'`
(note the single quotes around password.  The example on the fakerjs npm page did not suggest quotes, but using their syntax I was receiving connection errors.  I tried double and single quotes after reading some of the issues on the sequelize-auto git page.)

In order to check that the models are created properly I ran `mocha` tests for each table. I found this to be extremely helpful as the creation of multiple tables and making sure that the column names were fungible between dependencies probably saved me a lot of time.

```
      √ has property last_Name
      √ has property email
      1) has property personal
      2) has property enterprise
      √ has property company
      √ has property street_address
      √ has property city
      √ has property state
      √ has property zip
      3) has property work_phone
      4) has property cell_phone
      √ has property username
      √ has property password
```
This was the return from the first successful mocha test.  I had different column names in mysql that had spaces.  When the model transferred over I changed the spaced columns to camel case and didn't adjust in the main imported model.
      
Next step was to create a `Profile` class that encapsulates all the elements in the Profile table.  This class is used for creating fake data and testing the connections, routes, queries & rendering. Faker scripts will seed these databases initially and are located in the scripts folder.  Issues met when creating the fake data in context of the model definition was the presence initially of a primary & foreign key generated by random faker data.  I eliminated the keys in sequlize model definition.  This allowed transfer of clean data. Also needed to format the zip code and phone numbers that the faker methods were generating.  Initially I was getting random zip codes of 5 to 9 digits long with dashes.  I fixed this and the phone numbers by explicitly keying int he formats desired in hashed form, i.e. faker.address.zipCode("#####") & faker.phone.phoneNumber("(203)-###-####").



To facilitate calendar creation, profile rendering and offsite scheduling the basic design.
